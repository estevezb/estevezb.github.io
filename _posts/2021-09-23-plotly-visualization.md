In this post, we're going to create an interactive Plotly graph. The graph will display annual total amounts by year. 

```python
import plotly.graph_objects as go
# Create a list of box traces, one for each year
traces = []
# ... rest of the code
```

Here's an interactive visualization of annual total amounts by year:

{% include plotly_graph.html %}
